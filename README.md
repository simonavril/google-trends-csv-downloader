## Google Trend Infectious disease - Csv Downloader  

A downloader for Google trends that downloads CSV data. It provides authentication to Google services.

As part of a research project we needed to download about 4000 csv files representing the occurence of search terms on certain dates and areas of Australia.

The script will assess how many queries will be run and ask for a number of login/password since Google restricts the search quotas to 500 queries/person/day

## How to use

Edit 'searchTerms.py' and list the queries you are interested in.

run `python download.py'

Enter your Google credentials when asked for it.

**Internet-based infectious disease surveillance: assessing the merits and comparing performance across diseases**

Internet-based surveillance systems provide a novel approach to monitoring infectious diseases. Internet-based systems are economically, logistically and epidemiologically appealing and have shown significant promise. The potential for these systems has increased with growing global internet penetration and shifts in health-related information seeking behaviour. Whilst monitoring infectious diseases using internet-based data has been applied to single or small groups of infectious diseases, no study has systematically assessed the suitability of this approach for a wide range of infectious diseases of high public health importance and ranked them according to their suitability for monitoring using this approach. This study aims to assess correlations between a wide spectrum of infectious diseases and Internet metrics for related search terms and to identify diseases for which internet-based data could be used to support early warning systems.
